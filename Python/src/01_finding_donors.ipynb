You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n","\n","The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf).

above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n","\n","|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n","| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n","| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n","| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n","| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n","\n","Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively.

Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n","\n","$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n","\n","In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n","\n","Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most $50,000.  and those who make more), it's  clear most individuals do not make more than $50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say    \n","*this person does not make more than \\$50,000*  and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n","\n","\n","#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n","\n","**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n","\n","**Precision** tells us, what proportion of positive identifications was actualy  positive('50>=' == positive) correct?\n","It is a ratio of true positives(raw_income classified as positive, and which are actually positive) to all positives, in other words it is the ratio of\n","\n","`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n","\n","**Recall(sensitivity)**  tells us what proportion of actual positive was identified/classified correctly?\n","It is a ratio of true positives(doner classified as doner, and which are actually doner) to all the people that were actually doner, in other words it is the ratio of\n","\n","`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n","\n","For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores.

One real-world example of their application is making product recommendations to users, a specific example being the application of a gradient boosted decision tree model in the Netflix Prize competition on Kaggle (http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/GrandPrize2009_BPC_BellKor.pdf).\n","\n","• What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n","\n","The major strength of Ensemble Methods is that it is very difficult for the model to overfit, because the model only improves as you increase the complexity of the model (e.g. Bagging; by building more and more independent estimators, the resulting average of the estimators will only improve).\n","\n","• What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n","\n","The major weaknesses to do with Ensemble Methods are related to increased storage and computation. Since Ensemble Methods require multiple classifiers, there is a need for more storage for the classifiers which can be costly. In a simliar vein, all of the classifiers need to be processed, rather than just one, which means that the run time of the algorithm is higher.\n","\n","• What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n","\n","Since the task is to construct a model to perform binary classification of whether an individual makes over $50k or not, Ensemble Methods should generate valuable results.\n","\n","Decision Trees\n","\n","• Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n","\n","One real-world application of Decision Trees is in the 'Automated Identification of Cosmic-Ray Hits in Hubble Space Telescope Images' (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995PASP..107..279S). The goal of the model is to predict cosmic-ray hits, and has successfully done so with 95% accuracy. Decision Trees were well suited to the problem because of the need for fast classification time.\n","\n","• What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n","\n","The major strengths of Decision Tree models are that they are easy to use, run quickly, able to handle both categorical & numerical data, and graphically allow you to interpret the data.\n","\n","• What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n","\n","The major weakness of Decision Trees is that it is highly prone to overfitting. One solution to this is to track its performance and prune the branches so that not too many features are included.\n","\n","• What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n","\n","A Decision Tree model is a good candidate for this problem as Decision Tree models are particularly adept at binary classification, however it may run into problems due to the number of features (especially all the iterations of native-country) so care will have to be taken with regards to feature selection.\n","\n","Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n","\n","• Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n","\n","One real-world application of Support Vector Machines is in modelling the prediction for common diseases, in this particular case diabetes (https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6947-10-16). The SVM was used to select the best set of variables to classify individuals into categories relating to whether they had different stages of diabetes (Classifcation Scheme 1 being diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes vs. pre-diabetes or no diabetes and Classification Scheme II being undiagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes vs. no diabetes).\n","\n","• What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n","\n","SVMs work particularly well in complicated domains where there's a clear margin of separation.\n","\n","• What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n","\n","SVMs don't work well in large datasets because of the growing amount of time it takes to classify the data. They also don't work well when there's lots of noise, as SVMs can overfit to noise in the data.\n","\n","• What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n","\n","SVMs are strongly capable of classifying non-linear data which may prove useful in this dataset, but the main reason I chose the model was because I am curious to find out if this dataset is too large and has too many features for an SVM to perform successfully. In as valuable as it is to find the right models, I think it is equally valuable to prove to yourself that certain models may not be the best choice."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NM7h6T_bv1Jo"},"source":["### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n","To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data.

It had a higher Accuracy Score and F-score on the Testing Set for each number of samples than either the Decision Trees Classifier or the Support Vector Classifier. One flaw with the Decision Tree Classifier is that it appears to have overfitted on the training data, as it performed much better on the 300 samples of training data than it did on the test data. One flaw with the Support Vector Classifier was the amount of time it took to train the classifier and then to make predictions, making it more challenging to iterate on and improve quickly (as we will do in later sections). It was also not able to produce an F-score on neither the training subset nor the testing subset - likely because it was unable to predict a positive class at all, which would make F1 equal to 0/0. For these reasons, and for the reason that the AdaBoost Classifier performs particularly well on questions of binary classification, it would appear to be the best model to choose for CharityML."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JIHXmyoGv1Jq"},"source":["### Question 4 - Describing the Model in Layman's Terms\n","\n","* In one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML*, in layman's terms, how the final model chosen is supposed to work. Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction. Avoid using advanced mathematical jargon, such as describing equations.\n","\n","** HINT: **\n","\n","When explaining your model, if using external resources please include all citations."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o6J99Iurv1Jq"},"source":["**Answer:**\n","The model we have chosen to use is the AdaBoost Classifier, which is an Ensemble Method technique. In simple terms, the AdaBoost Classifier is just a combination of a bunch of different learning algorithms that are slightly better at making predictions than flipping a coin. Based on how good they are at classifying the data, they have greater influence over the resulting model. One clever part of this technique is that its predictions are improved by simple models that classify the data in wholly different ways; the diversity in the classification of each model, the stronger the resulting weighted sum of the models is. A good way to think about the technique is to think about adding the models sequentially, and in a subsequent model placing less emphasis on points that had been correctly categorised previously and more emphasis on the points that were incorrectly categorised previously.\n","\n","A very crude analogy one could make is mixing different types of alcohol on a night out. Let's pretend that getting drunk is like classifying data. If you drink solely beer, you will be able to get drunk, but not nearly as drunk as you would as if you were to also drink wine and tequila because of the different components of the alcohol (e.g. grain vs fruit vs cactus). Each alcohol has a different physiological effect on your body, and different sources interact in a way that heightens its effect. In this way, mixing different models together with differing weights can help improve classification. Interestingly, the more models included, the better the classification, in a similar fashion to the more different types of alcohol you drink, the drunker you become; this is a unique and somewhat counterintuitive property of boosting methods because one would assume adding more models would lead to overfitting, but it does not occur.

I did not predict capital-loss being as strong a feature as capital-gain, and my #1 choice of Occupation didn't make the top 5, though all the rest made it (albeit in a different order). I think it makes sense that age, capital gain/loss, hours-per-week, and education-num would have a strong effect as I outlined above, though I would have expected education-num to have had a bigger effect than age.

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data.
